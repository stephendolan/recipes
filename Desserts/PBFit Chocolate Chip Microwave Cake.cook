In a #microwave-safe mug{}, combine the @all-purpose flour{4%tablespoons}, @PB Fit powder{2%tablespoons}, @sugar{2%tablespoons}, @baking powder{1/4%teaspoon}, and -@salt{pinch}. Mix well to ensure even distribution.

Add the @milk{5%tablespoons}, @melted coconut oil{1%tablespoon}, and @vanilla extract{1/4%teaspoon} to the dry ingredients. Stir until the mixture is smooth and no lumps remain.

Stir in the @chocolate chips{2%tablespoons}, distributing them evenly throughout the batter.

Microwave on high for ~{1%minute} to ~{1.5%minutes}, depending on the wattage of your microwave. Start checking at the 1-minute mark; the cake should be set but still slightly moist in the center.

Allow the cake to cool for ~{1%minute} to ~{2%minutes} before eating. Enjoy it directly from the mug or transfer it to a plate.
