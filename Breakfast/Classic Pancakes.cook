In a #bowl{large}, whisk together @flour{1 1/2%cups}, @sugar{2%tbsp}, @baking powder{2%tsp}, and -@salt{1/2%tsp}.

In a separate #bowl{medium}, whisk @egg{1}, @milk{1 1/4%cups}, @butter{3%tbsp}(melted), and @vanilla extract{1%tsp}.

Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and stir until just combined. A few lumps are fine.

> Don't overmix! Overmixing develops gluten and makes pancakes tough.

Heat a #griddle{} or #frying pan{} over medium heat. Lightly grease with @butter{1%tbsp}.

Pour @batter{1/4%cup} per pancake onto the hot surface. Cook until bubbles form on surface and edges look set, about ~{2-3%minutes}.

Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about ~{1-2%minutes} more.

Serve warm with ?@maple syrup{}, ?@fresh berries{}, or ?@whipped cream{}.

> Pancakes can be kept warm in a 200°F oven while cooking remaining batches.
